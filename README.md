# Project Description

- Built and implemented an HTTP server that serves secret user data  
- Access to the secret data was authenticated through one of two mechanisms: (I) user name and password, and (II) cookies presented from successful prior authentication 
- Used the HTTP protocol and built versions of these authentication mechanisms to render browser-readable data
